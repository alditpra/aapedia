        export default defineConfig({
          site: 'https://your-domain.com', 
          // ...
        });
        ```
2.  **Primary Site Metadata & Settings**:
    *   Update `src/config/site.ts` for essential site details such as:
        *   `title`: The main title of your site.
        *   `description`: A brief description for SEO and metadata.
        *   `author`: Default author name.

        *   `site.favicon`: Path to your `.ico` favicon.

        *   `contactinfo`: Your address, email, and phone number for display.

## Customization

### Styling

This theme uses **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling, which emphasizes a CSS-first, minimal-configuration approach.

**Key Styling Files:**

*   **`src/styles/global.css`**: This is the central file for Tailwind CSS setup and custom styles.
    *   Tailwind's core styles (base, components, utilities) are imported via `@import "tailwindcss";`.
    *   The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is included using `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";`.
    *   You can customize the theme by modifying the CSS variables defined in this file, which control colors, fonts, and other aspects.
    *   You can also add your own custom CSS rules here.

*   **`astro.config.mjs`**: The `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin is integrated here, but typically requires no direct configuration for v4 unless you have very specific needs.

**Advanced Customization (Optional):**

While most styling can be managed through `src/styles/global.css`, if you need to make advanced Tailwind customizations (e.g., adding complex custom themes, other specific Tailwind plugins that require JS configuration, or modifying Tailwind's default settings extensively), you can create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the project root. The `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin should automatically detect and use this file. Refer to the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for details on `tailwind.config.js` options.

### Adding New Pages

Create a new `.astro` file in the `src/pages/` directory. The file path will determine the URL.

## Deployment

Build your site for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed to your favorite hosting platform.
